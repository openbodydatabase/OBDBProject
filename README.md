# The Open Body Database Project
Archiving and Sharing Human Body Data for Design and Research

# Welcome!

Thank you for visiting The Open Body Database (OBDB) project repository.
This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.

# The problems
Garment design is not based on real human bodies
No human body data repository exists for designers and researchers looking to work with real human body forms
Sharing body data is complex due to issues of privacy

The garment industry utilizes unproportional design sketches and standard pattern grading and sizing to continue the mass production value chain. Access to body database(s) can be expensive and restricted, and therefore not user friendly to designers, researchers or students wishing to access real human body data and shapes.   

# The solution
The Open Body Database will:
Create and Open Body Database where anyone can access real human body data
Crete guides for anyone to contribute real body data
Create an automated data anonymization system


If proper tools and real body shapes are provided, the cycle of mass produced garment production can be altered creating an era of customization, design based on reality and healthier fashion and body outlooks. Designers, researchers, and students can access real human bodies and data, truly extending fashion and research utilizing the rich diversity of body realities. 

# Who are we?

The founders of the Open Body Database - Elizabeth and Luis - are friends from middle school. There’s soon to be more information about them (and photos) in the MeetTheTeam file. 
The development of the database is mentored by the Open Leaders Cohort C-McCohortface of Mozilla Open Leaders 2018 program, to support the development of working open and leading open. The program and exercises focused on how to build this project and database as an open project, open community and to create open engagement.

# What do we need?

You! Whomever you are and in whatever way you can help! 
We need expertise in system architecture, data contribution, data schemas, user experience design, database maintenance, documentation, technical writing and project management. We’d love continuous feedback, notes and thoughts as we continue building the Open Body Database.
