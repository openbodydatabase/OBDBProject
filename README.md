# What are we doing?

We are building The Open Body Database, an open-source platform for archiving and sharing human body data, to foster design and research based on real human bodies.

We are working open because we believe the human body belongs to every unique human and such a resource must be built from an open community with body positivity outlook and acceptance of all preferences.

## The problems
⋅⋅* Garment design is not based on real human bodies
⋅⋅* No human body data repository exists for designers and researchers looking to work with real human body forms
⋅⋅* Sharing body data is complex due to issues of privacy

The garment industry utilizes unproportional design sketches and standard pattern grading and sizing to continue the mass production value chain. Access to body database(s) can be expensive and restricted, and therefore not user friendly to designers, researchers or students wishing to access real human body data and shapes.   

## The solution
The Open Body Database will:
⋅⋅* Create and Open Body Database where anyone can access real human body data
⋅⋅* Create guides for anyone to contribute real body data
⋅⋅* Create an automated data anonymization system


If proper tools and real body shapes are provided, the cycle of mass produced garment production can be altered creating an era of customization, design based on reality and healthier fashion and body outlooks. Designers, researchers, and students can access real human bodies and data, truly extending fashion and research utilizing the rich diversity of body realities. 

# Who are we?

The founders of the Open Body Database - Elizabeth and Luis - are partners in life and creating. There’s soon to be more information about them (and photos) in the MeetTheTeam file. The development of the database is mentored by the Open Leaders Cohort C-McCohortface of [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) program, to support the development of working open and leading open. The program and exercises focused on how to build this project and database as an open project, open community and to create open engagement.

# What do we need?

You! Whomever you are and in whatever way you can help! 
We need expertise in system architecture, data contribution, data schemas, user experience design, database maintenance, documentation, technical writing and project management. We’d love continuous feedback, notes and thoughts as we continue building the Open Body Database. 

# Get involved

If you think you can help in any of the areas above or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and we are sure you can!) then please check out our contributors' guidelines and our roadmap.
Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us we ask that you follow our code of conduct in all interactions both on and offline.

# Contact us

If you want to report a problem or suggest an enhancement we'd love for you to open an issue at this github repository because then we can get right on it. But you can also contact Luis and Elizabeth by email (contact AT obdb DOT org).
